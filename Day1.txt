function areTrue(a, b) {
    return (a === true) ? (b === true) ? "both" 
    :  "first" 
    : (a === false && b === true) ? "second" 
    :  "neither"
}


obj = areTrue(true,true)
console.log(obj)

funtion .......{
if (a == true) {
    if (b == true) {
        return "both";
    }
    else {
        return "first";
    }
}
else if (b = true) {
    return "second";
